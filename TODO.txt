Developer notes for MetroPix

Generic URL parsing - metropix user enters on a URL, we need to:
  - Dispatch the HTML parsing for that URL to a known parser
  - Dispatch the HTML parsing for that URL to a default parser
  - Offer an upsell experience(?) for key sites such as Flickr, 500px etc.

Where are the URLs that make up a user's favorites stored?
  - Simplest thing is a scrolling list of Favorites on their home page
  - Need to have some categories - RSS feeds, Favorite photos, Favorite albums?


While browsing a photo, we need a few other key features
  - Add to Photos Library - download locally
  - Add to Skydrive Library - upload to the sky?


What are the key sites that we need to work with?
  - 500px: the most beautiful photos are generally here
  - The Big Picture: there are fantastic AP photos here

We need some kind of searchable captioning mechanism
  - Store metadata for pictures locally?
  - Make that metadata searchable?
  - Should the OS do this for us using the system indexer? Need sample
  - Ideally would sync across multiple machines
  - Should we use SkyDrive for this? Or should I add easy DropBox integration?
